Hello I'm Danika Shumate.
I live in the mountains of North Carolina. I like to program with my dad and longboard in my spare time.
I have awesome parents and a brother who should grow up to be a comedian.
I also have amazing friends and sometimes we get into some trouble. When I grow up i want to be a game designer or a programmer. I love to sing and want to learn to play the guitar. I know I have a few hidden talents I didn't think I had when I was younger.
